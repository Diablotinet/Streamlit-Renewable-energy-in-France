**Technologies:** Python, Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, Folium

### Problem Statement

**Central Question:** How has France's renewable energy landscape evolved across regions and energy types from 2008 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the country's path to carbon neutrality by 2050?

**Target Audience:** 
- Energy policy makers and government officials responsible for national energy strategy
- Regional administrators making infrastructure investment decisions
- Environmental organizations tracking France's climate commitments
- Energy sector analysts and researchers
- Citizens interested in understanding France's energy transition

**Key Takeaways:**
- Regional production disparities reveal where infrastructure investment is needed
- Energy mix composition shows overreliance on hydraulic power and climate vulnerability
- Temporal trends demonstrate rapid wind expansion but uneven solar adoption
- Geographic advantages (mountains, coasts, plains) drive specialization patterns
- Strategic recommendations for accelerating renewable deployment in lagging regions

## Data Story Narrative

### Narrative Pattern: Before/After Change Over Time + Regional Comparison

This dashboard follows a structured narrative arc that moves from problem identification through analysis to actionable insights.

#### 1. Hook - The Carbon Neutrality Challenge

France has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 under the Paris Climate Agreement. Renewable energy must replace fossil fuels across electricity generation, transportation, and heating. Understanding where renewable production occurs, which technologies succeed, and where gaps exist determines whether this goal is achievable.

The stakes are high: failure means continued carbon emissions, climate penalties, and energy import dependency. Success requires understanding 16 years of production data across 13 French regions to identify patterns, predict bottlenecks, and allocate resources effectively.

#### 2. Context - The Landscape

- **Geographic Coverage:** 13 French metropolitan regions
- **Time Period:** 2008-2024 (16 years of evolution)
- **Energy Sources Tracked:**
  - Hydraulic power (dams, rivers)
  - Wind energy (onshore turbines)
  - Solar photovoltaic (panels, farms)
  - Bioenergy (biomass, biogas)
  - Total renewable electricity
  
France's geography creates natural advantages: Alpine regions for hydraulic, coastal plains for wind, southern territories for solar. However, production concentration creates vulnerability when weather patterns shift or infrastructure fails.

#### 3. Key Insights

**Geographic Disparities:**
- Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes produces 35% of national renewable electricity due to mountainous terrain enabling massive hydroelectric capacity
- Grand Est leads wind energy deployment across flat, windy plains in northeastern France
- Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur captures solar potential with Mediterranean climate advantages
- Île-de-France (Paris region) produces minimal renewable energy despite high consumption

**Temporal Evolution:**
- Wind energy capacity expanded 150% between 2016-2021, driven by favorable economics and policy support
- Solar photovoltaic remains constrained to southern regions, growing slowly due to installation costs and northern climate limitations
- Hydraulic production shows year-to-year volatility based on rainfall and snowpack, creating climate risk
- Regional inequality widened over time as high-performing regions accelerated while others stagnated

**Energy Mix Patterns:**
- Hydraulic power dominates at 65% of total renewable production, creating overreliance on weather-dependent source
- Most regions specialize in one energy type rather than diversifying, increasing grid stability risk
- Technology costs declined significantly for wind and solar, making expansion economically viable
- Grid infrastructure limits renewable integration in regions distant from consumption centers

#### 4. Implications and Recommendations

**For National Policy Makers:**
- Build high-voltage transmission lines connecting high-production regions (Auvergne) to consumption centers (Île-de-France)
- Establish financial incentives for renewable deployment in lagging regions (Normandie, Bretagne)
- Diversify energy mix to reduce weather dependency and improve grid stability
- Accelerate offshore wind development along Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts

**For Regional Administrators:**
- Leverage local geographic advantages: mountains for hydro, coasts for wind, south for solar
- Modernize electrical grids to handle distributed renewable generation
- Attract renewable energy companies through tax incentives and streamlined permitting
- Engage citizens in community solar and wind projects

**For Energy Investors:**
- High-growth opportunities in underutilized regions (Centre-Val de Loire, Pays de la Loire)
- Solar expansion potential in Occitanie and Nouvelle-Aquitaine as technology costs decline
- Offshore wind projects offer scale advantages along extensive coastlines
- Energy storage solutions critical to complement intermittent renewable sources

- Session State: GeoJSON stored in st.session_state to avoid re-parsing

**2. Visualization Layer**
- Plotly: Primary library for interactive charts (3D, maps, statistical)
- Folium: Fallback for alternative mapping (currently not used)
- Modular Functions: Each chart is a separate cached function

**3. UI/UX Layer**
- Streamlit Components: Native widgets for filters and controls
- Responsive Layout: use_container_width=True for all charts
- Tab Organization: 6 logical groupings of related visualizations
